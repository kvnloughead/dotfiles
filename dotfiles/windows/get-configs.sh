# Haven't figured out how to symlink with Windows files. Instead, I have copies of the
# config files stored in ~/dotfiles/program-name. 
#
# 1. To open the real versions for editing, `micro $name-of-config`. For some 
#    reason vscode is insisting on opening them with their windows filepath
#    in spite of the fact that I have helpfully converted them already.
# 2. To update the copy of the config file, run the relevant getter function
#
# When initially setting up a new computer, or any time you want to update the configs
# from the copies, run the relevant setter command.
