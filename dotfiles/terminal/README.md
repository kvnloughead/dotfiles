# Annoying workaround

I haven't figured out how to symlink my terminal settings yet. Here is the
workaround. I've worked around it by storing a copy of the file here and writing
an alias to copy it.

1. To open the config file, run `micro $terminalconfig`. The editor is arbitrary.
2. To update the the config copy, run `get-terminal-config`.
